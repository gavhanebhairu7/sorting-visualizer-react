A dynamic and interactive web application built with React that visually demonstrates various sorting algorithms. This project allows users to input an array of numbers, choose from different sorting algorithms, and watch as the array is sorted step-by-step with animations.


## Features

- **Interactive Sorting Visualization**: Choose from a variety of popular sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- **Random array generation**: Automatically generates random array of numbers with custom size and minimum and maximum values.
- **Control Execution**: Start, pause, and stop the sorting process at any time. A dedicated "Stop" button halts the execution of the currently running algorithm.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is designed to work seamlessly on various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library used for building the user interface.
- **JavaScript/ES6**: Core language for implementing sorting algorithms and interactive features.
- **CSS**: Custom styling to enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of the application.
